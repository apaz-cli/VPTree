	 * distance function inside the native code. Therefore, it's recommended that
	 * the distance function never throw an exception under any circumstances. If it
	 * does, it's possible that the entire JVM could go haywire.
	 * 
	 * This includes unchecked exceptions, such as running out of memory or hitting
	 * recursion limits. It's recommended therefore not to create objects with "new"
	 * inside the distance function. This point is somewhat moot because if you run
	 * out of memory allocating an object, or hit recursion limit, the JVM will halt
	 * anyway. But if it happens, it may not crash in the way that you're used to.
